Enterprise Network Simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer
🚀 Developed a comprehensive enterprise network simulation modeling a multi-department corporate environment using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Input Features
VLAN segmentation for departments

Core, distribution, and access layer switches

Routers enabling inter-VLAN routing

Network devices including PCs, laptops, servers

Output
A fully functional network topology supporting segmented traffic, routing, and security.

🔗 Network Design
Segmented VLANs isolate departments to improve security and performance.

Layer 3 routing connects VLANs enabling cross-department communication.

Redundant links between core and distribution layers ensure fault tolerance.

Access control lists (ACLs) enforce traffic filtering policies.

🚀 Advantages
Simulates real-world enterprise network behavior with scalability and security.

Provides hands-on practice with Cisco Packet Tracer’s routing, switching, and ACL features.

Helps understand network architecture principles and protocols.

📚 Training
Configurations and topology are implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer .pkt file.

Network devices configured for DHCP, DNS, routing protocols, and security.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Cisco Packet Tracer

Networking protocols (VLAN, OSPF/EIGRP/static routing)

💡 How to Use
Install Cisco Packet Tracer (recommended version X.X).

Open EnterpriseNetwork.pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Review device setup and VLAN configurations.

Run simulations to verify connectivity, routing, and ACLs.

Modify and experiment with configurations to learn more.

⚡ Installation
